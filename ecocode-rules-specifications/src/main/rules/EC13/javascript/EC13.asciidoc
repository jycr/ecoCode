## Rule details

This rule aims to reduce the size and thus the network weight of API returns that may contain many elements. This rule is built for the https://nestjs.com[NestJS framework] but can work with a controller `@Controller()` and a decorated method `@Get()`.

## Examples

Examples of **non-compliant** code for this rule:

```typescript
@Controller()
class Test {
  @Get()
  public find(): Promise<string[]> {}
}
```

Examples of **compliant** code for this rule:

```typescript
interface Pagination {
  items: string[];
  currentPage: number;
  totalPages: number;
}

@Controller()
class Test {
  @Get()
  public find(): Promise<Pagination> {}
}
```
